# Overview
The purpose of this UFO Sighting analysis is to allow visitors to the UFO Sightings website be able to filter the available data based on various criteria. There is a large amount of data present for the UFO sightings and it will be a great help to someone if they can filter the data to find what they are looking for. With the added feature of being able to filter the data based on either a date, city, state, country, or shape of the UFO sighting, the amount of data on the page becomes easier for the page visitor to break down.

Seen above is the completed UFO sightings webpage. The website features the data gathered on the sightings and the various search boxes that users can filter the webpage with. The page is complete with another feature at the top left of the screen. When the visitro of the webpage wants to return to the priginal screen after adding a filter, they can click on "UFO Sightings" and the filters that they entered will be cleared and all of the data will appear on the screen. 

The user can take advantage of the various search critera on the webpage to make their search through the uUFO data more manageable. Seen below are the five different fields a visitor to the webpage can use to narrow their search.

The first box allows the user to filter the data by date of thr UFO signting and the table will only show sightings of the entered date. The second box allows users to filter by the city of the UFO sighting. Filtering by state of the sighting is the next option and then by country. These fields may come in handy for someone curious about which state, city, or country in the world has experienced the most UFO sightings. The last option on the page to filter by is the shape that was observed during the UFO sighting. Each of these fields will filter the table so that only the specified entry is shown to the user.

# Summary 
A drawback to the current design of the website is that the user will first have to look through the provided data in order to see the options they have to filter through. There is not a dropdown list of various dates, cities, states, countries, or shapes for the user to choose from. They will need to scroll and see potential options that they can enter in the filter boxes. 

To further developement on the webpage, it would be helpful and more user friendly to add a dropdown menu for each of the filter fields. This will allow to user to see available data at a glance for each of the fields instead of having to scroll through and determine the options themselves. Another addition that would be helpful for the webpage would be to allow the page to continually pull new data into the website. Right now the user only has a fixed amount of data to search through and they are unable to see any new UFO sightings on the website. This feature would keep the webpage up to date with any new sightings that are reported.
